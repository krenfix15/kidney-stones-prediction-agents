JADE Agents and ML for kidney stones predictions based on real analyses taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/kidney-stone-prediction-based-on-urine-analysis.

This is my thesis for finishing the CS master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and is represented by an application based on the Java Agent Development Framework (JADE) that uses a neural network to predict the presence of kidney stones. The project's main idea is a system to aid in the early detection of kidney stones by analyzing patient data and predicting the likelihood of their presence.

# What I Learned
* How to develop applications using JADE and agent oriented programming
* How neural networks work and their application in medical diagnostics
* How to preprocess medical data for neural network training and testing

The documentation and presentation can be found in the repository.
